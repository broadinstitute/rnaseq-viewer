Main features:
- Supports these file formats: .bigWig, .junctions.bed.gz, .vcf, .bam, .cram.
- Includes reference tracks from GTEx v8 muscle, blood, and fibroblast samples.
- Lets you display data files or reference tracks from any Google bucket to which you have read-access.
- Retrieves just the on-screen sections of the files directly from Google buckets.
- Allows gene or locus lists to be added to side bars for quick navigation across a list of regions.
